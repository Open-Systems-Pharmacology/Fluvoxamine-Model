The PBPK model for fluvoxamine was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* intravenous and oral administration
* single and multiple doses 
* a dose range from 25 mg to 200 mg
* subjects phenotyped as CYP2D6 *extensive metabolizers* (*EM*) and *poor metabolizers* (*PM*)
* smokers and non-smokers

The model quantifies metabolism via CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 and the effect of smoking and different CYP2D6 phenotypes on fluvoxamine metabolism.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
