The general workflow for building an adult PBPK model has been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-references)). Relevant information on the anthropometry (height, weight) was gathered from the respective clinical study, if reported. Information on physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, hematocrit) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been incorporated in PK-Sim速 as described previously ([Willmann 2007](#5-references)). The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim速 are described in the publicly available 'PK-Sim速 Ontogeny Database Version 7.3' ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-references)).

The PBPK model was built based on healthy individuals, using the reported mean values for age, weight, height, and genetic background for each study protocol. If no information on these parameters could be found, a healthy male European individual, 30 years of age, with a body weight of 73 kg and a height of 176 cm was used. To model the specific metabolic clearance,  CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 were implemented in accordance with literature, using the PK-Sim expression database RT-PCR profiles ([Meyer 2012](#5-references)) to define their relative expression in the different organs of the body. Glomerular filtration and enterohepatic cycling were enabled, as they are involved in fluvoxamine excretion.

Unknown parameters (see below) were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim速. 

The model was then verified by simulating:

- single and multiple dose studies
- the effect of smoking on CYP1A2 metabolism of fluvoxamine
- plasma levels of fluvoxamine in CYP2D6 extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM).

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in [Section 2.2](#22-data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in [Section 2.3](#23-model-parameters-and-assumptions).
