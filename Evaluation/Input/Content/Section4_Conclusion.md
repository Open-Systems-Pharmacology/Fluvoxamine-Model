The developed PBPK model of fluvoxamine describes the PK data after administrations of single as well as multiple doses well. The predictions of the 50 mg dose align closer to the studies where higher concentrations were observed. The most likely explanation is the smoking status of the subjects in the studies showing lower concentrations. Cigarette smoke is known to induce the CYP1A2 enzyme system. Hence, lower fluvoxamine concentrations would be expected in smokers due to the higher metabolism. Although there is no built-in smoking status in PK-Sim, this could be modeled by adapting CYP1A2 expression.

In two studies, data from poor metabolizers were available ([Carillo 1996](#5-References), [Spigset 1997](#5-References)). Concentrations reported by [Carillo 1996](#5-References) were much higher than what [Spigset 1997](#5-References) reported for the subset of PM data. However, notice that plasma levels of extensive metabolizers were also higher in the Carillo-study compared to the other reports. Subjects in the Spigset 1997 dataset were all non-smokers. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.

The estimated values for Km and Kcat defining the metabolization of fluvoxamine by CYP2D6 were highly correlated (correlation of 0.93), indicating that more data would still be needed to estimate the saturable process with more precision.
