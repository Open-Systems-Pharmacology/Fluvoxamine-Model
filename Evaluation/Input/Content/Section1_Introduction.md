The presented PBPK model of fluvoxamine has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with fluvoxamine as an inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP1A2.

Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. After oral administration, fluvoxamine-maleate is absorbed moderately fast with peak plasma concentrations reached at approx. 2-4 hours post-dose. Approximately 77% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. The concentration-time profile elicits a bi-phasic shape ([Perucca 1994](#5-References)). Fluvoxamine is extensively metabolised via CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations increase non-proportionally with increasing doses, suggesting (partially) saturable metabolism. Fluvoxamine is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 ([FDA DDI Labeling](#5-References)), and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A (AUCR <2) ([Lam 2003](#5-References)). Only a very minor part of the dose is recovered unchanged in the urine.
